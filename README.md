<h1>Good to see you, I'm John Erinjery!</h1>

I am a Second-year BS-MS Physics Research Student Studying in IISER Pune. <br>
I'm interested in astrophysics; especially gravitational astrophysics. I enjoy studying morphology of galaxies, dynamics of galaxy clusters and evolution of celestial objects, particularly stars and nebulae. <br>

---
The coding that I do consists of academic projects, devoloping and maintaining my websites, devoloping CLI's for my convinience, and other less serious pursiuits.
</br>
I am currently working on devoloping image processing tools using C and Python for processing astronomical data.
